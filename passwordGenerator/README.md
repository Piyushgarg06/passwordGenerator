# 🔐 React Password Generator

> Because who doesn’t love using `useState` for a feature that could’ve been done in 15 lines of vanilla JS? 😅

## 🚀 About

This is a simple yet **overengineered password generator** built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

Instead of sticking to good old HTML/CSS/JS, I challenged myself to:

- Practice React Hooks like:
  - `useState`
  - `useRef`
  - `useEffect`
  - `useCallback`
- Experiment with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Overcomplicate something simple for the sake of learning 🙃

And yes, it works beautifully — it generates strong random passwords with adjustable length and character options!
